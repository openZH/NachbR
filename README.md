# Zurich "Baupublikationen" Toolkit

The Zurich "Baupublikationen" Toolkit is built to work with official building permit data from the canton of Zurich. These data reflect all construction projects for which a building application has been submitted‚Äîan obligatory step for any building activity in the canton. Since 2019, such applications have been published exclusively in digital form via the Amtsblatt portal.

The source data is maintained by individual municipalities, which record and submit building applications directly to the [Amtsblattportal](https://amtsblattportal.ch/#!/home). There, the applications are made publicly accessible, typically for up to one year. This toolkit is designed to systematically **retrieve**, **process**, and **structure** these publications so they can be used for **spatial analysis**, **monitoring**, and **visualization**.

It's important to note that a building application represents a legal notice‚Äîit does not guarantee that a project will be carried out as proposed. The toolkit does not track the outcome or execution status of a permit.

## Main Functions Overview
### Retrieving and Processing XML-files

#### `get_new_pub_url(page_size, url, params, df_bp)`
Generates a list of XML URLs for newly published permits by comparing against existing IDs.

- `page_size`: Number of entries to fetch per request (default = 100)
- `url`: API base URL
- `params`: A named list of query parameters (e.g., publication date range, cantons)
- `df_bp`: Existing data frame from OGD distribution (optional)

#### `create_baupub_df(url)`
A wrapper function of `xml_to_df()`. Takes a list of XML URLs, retrieves the XML-files (without saving them) and converts them into a cleaned, structured data frame.

- `url`: Vector of XML URLs (output of `get_new_pub_url()`)

##### `xml_to_df(xml)`

‚öôÔ∏è Core Function ‚Äì Not user-facing, but central to the toolkit's architecture.

Parses a single XML-file recursively, extracting and flattening all terminal (leaf) nodes into a structured format. This function is the backbone of the data transformation process used by create_baupub_df().

`xml`: XML-file

> **Note**:
The cadaster numbers are cleaned in this process which are required for geo-referencing the involved parcels of a building project. It is important to mention that an error-free cleaning of the cadaster numbers cannot be guaranteed. Cadaster numbers are provided by the municipalities and have no standard format. Therefore, it is possible that even after cleaning some cadaster numbers (in combination with the BFS-Nr.) cannot be matched to a specific parcel.



#### `download_xml_files(path, params)`
Downloads all available Baupublikationen as XML files from the official API based on the selected parameters.

- `path`: Folder path to store XML files
- `params`: A named list of query parameters (e.g., publication date range, cantons)


### Add Spatial Information and Map Building Project

#### `get_liegenschaften_layer(file_destination, email_address, retrieval_day)`
Returns the "Liegenschaften"-layer provided by the [Geo-Portal](https://geo.zh.ch/).

- `file_destination`: Character string indicating the local folder where the shapefile should be saved.
- `email_address`: A valid email address required to authenticate the download request via the GISZH API.
- `retrieval_day`: The weekday (e.g., "Monday") on which the file should be automatically re-downloaded if the script is run on that day (the layer is updated on a weekly basis).

> **Note**:
Executing `get_liegenschaften_layer()` can take up to two hours due to infrastructure constraints in the Geo-Portal.

#### `add_spatial_information(df_bp, sf_liegenschaften)`
Converts a cleaned permit data frame into a spatial layer (sf) and enriches it with address, deadline, and URL information.

- `df_bp`: Cleaned building permit data
- `sf_liegenschaften`: Official Zurich land parcel spatial layer

üìå The result is in EPSG:2056.


#### `create_map(sf_bp_geo)`
Generates an interactive Leaflet map of permits.
- `sf_bp_geo`: Spatial permit layer (output from add_spatial_information())

üó∫Ô∏è Returns an interactive map with popups, styled polygons, and zoom-to-fit behavior.



### Example Workflow

```

# Step 1: Setup
params <- list(
  publicationStates = "PUBLISHED",
  rubrics = "BP-ZH",
  subrubrics = "BP-ZH01",
  publicationDate.start = "2025-06-01",
  publicationDate.end = as.character(Sys.Date()),
  cantons = "ZH",
  pageRequest.size = 100
  )

url <- "https://amtsblattportal.ch/api/v1/publications/xml?"

# Step 2: get the url of the publications based on parameters
new_urls <-  get_new_pub_url(page_size = 100, url, params)

# Step 3: convert multiple xml to a single data frame
df_bp <- create_baupub_df(new_urls)

# Step 4: Retrieve Liegenschaften-information
sf_liegenschaften <- get_liegenschaften_layer("YOUR_DESTINATION",
                                              "YOUR_NAME@example.com",
                                              "Monday")

# Step 5: Add spatial Information
sf_bp <- df_bp |> 
  add_spatial_information(sf_liegenschaften)

# Step 6: Visualize building projects
sf_bp |> create_map()



```






## Replicate OGD dataset
### `create_OGD_df(days_of_data, base_file_path)`
Downloads and processes XML-based building permit publications from the official Amtsblatt API. If an existing dataset from the Zurich OGD portal exists, it appends new publications. Otherwise, it fetches all available data.

- `days_of_data`: Number of days to look back, or `"all"` for full history
- `base_file_path`: Path for local file storage

### `create_gpkg(gpkg_file, df_bp, sf_liegenschaften)`
Writes building permit data to a **GeoPackage (.gpkg)**. If the file exists, only new entries (based on `id`) are appended.

- `gpkg_file`: Destination path of the `.gpkg` file
- `df_bp`: Data frame of permit data
- `sf_liegenschaften`: Spatial dataset of land parcels for spatial joins. This spatial dataset can be (down)loaded using the function `get_liegenschaften_layer()`.
  
    Note that executing `get_liegenschaften_layer()` can take up to two hours due to infrastructure constraints in the Geo-Portal.

### `create_map(sf_bp_geo)`
Generates a **Leaflet map** with detailed popups including permit number, date, address, deadlines, and overlapping projects.

- `sf_bp_geo`: The layer that was written to `baupub.gpkg`

### Example OGD workflow

```
# Step 1: Setup
base_file_path <- "PATH/TO/YOUR/WORKING_DIRECTORY"
baupub_gpkg_file <- paste0(base_file_path, "gpkg/baupub.gpkg")
liegenschaften_dest <- paste0(base_file_path, "/gpkg")

# Step 2: Download latest building permit publications (here the last 30 days)
df_bp <- create_OGD_df(days_of_data = 30, base_file_path = NULL)

# Step 3: If not already available otherwise, download Liegenschaften-data
sf_liegenschaften <- get_liegenschaften_layer(liegenschaften_dest,
                                              "YOUR.NAME@EXAMPLE.com",
                                              "Monday")

# Step 4: Prepare spatial info (requires sf_liegenschaften shapefile)
sf_bp <- add_spatial_information(df_bp, sf_liegenschaften)

# Step 5: Export to GeoPackage
create_gpkg("baupub.gpkg", df_bp, sf_liegenschaften)

# Step 6: Visualize in an interactive map
create_map(sf_bp)
```
