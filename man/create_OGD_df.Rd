\usage{
create_OGD_df(days_of_data, base_file_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{days_of_data}{Integer or Character. If a numeric value is provided, it
specifies the number of days in the past from which to retrieve publications.
If set to \code{"all"}, all available publications will be downloaded.}

\item{base_file_path}{Character. The base file path for storing or referencing
#' local files in future implementations.}
}

legal entity information. If no new data is found and an existing dataset is
available, it returns the existing dataset.
}
\description{
Downloads and processes XML publications from the Amtsblattportal of the
canton of Zurich. If the Baugesuche OGD resource is already available online,
it is used as a baseline and new entries are appended. Otherwise, all
available publications are downloaded and processed.
}
\details{
The function interacts with:
\itemize{
\item The Zurich Statistics Office's OGD resource (a CSV hosted online),
\item The Amtsblattportal API (for retrieving current XML publications).
}

It determines whether to fetch all data, new data only, or return an existing
resource depending on the \code{days_of_data} argument and the presence of new
publication URLs.
